## Rules:

1. Github Copilot must be disabled (Ctrl + Alt + L), only use it if you get stuck on any problem after 5 or 10 minutes.
2. It would be awesome to complete a guide per practice day, but if it's not possible, then try to complete at least half of its content.
3. Concentrate, use Spotify to play music or whatever, just focus on completing the task.
4. No major breaks allowed, just some minutes to drink water, eat a snack or go to the bathroom.
